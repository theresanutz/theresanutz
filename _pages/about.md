Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. 

My research centers around social inequality with a focus on gender and wealth disparities over the life course. My current work lies at the intersection of family and wealth, examining intragenerational accumulation and intergenerational transfer processes. In my research, I draw on large-scale panel survey data, administrative register data, and experimental data. I use methods from the quantitative toolbox, such as sequence analysis and panel data analysis.

I completed my Ph.D. in sociology at the Department of Social Sciences at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 2022. In my thesis, I examined how women’s and men’s life course biographies shape their wealth outcomes within couples in later life in different contexts.

At GESIS, I work on the novel panel study FReDA – The German Family Demography Panel Study. Data from the first recruitment wave from 2021 can be found here. For more information on the content and study design of FReDA, have a look here.
