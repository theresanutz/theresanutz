Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. 

My research centers around the intersection of social inequality and family sociology from a life course perspective. I am also interested in survey research, aiming to improve respondents' self-administered survey experiences. In my research, I draw on large-scale panel survey data, administrative register data, and experimental data. I use methods from the quantitative toolbox, such as sequence analysis and panel data analysis.

I completed my Ph.D. in sociology at the Department of Social Sciences at Humboldt University of Berlin in 2022. In my [thesis](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/25603), I examined how women’s and men’s life course biographies shape their wealth outcomes within couples in later life in different contexts.

At GESIS, I work on the novel panel study FReDA – The German Family Demography Panel Study. The newest data release can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.14080). For more information on the content and study design of FReDA, have a look [here](https://www.freda-panel.de/FReDA/EN/Data/Daten).
